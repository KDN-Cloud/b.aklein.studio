I was recently introduced to a decentralized social network named <a href="https://nostr.com/" target="_blank">Nostr</a> as a very strong rival to Twitter. The name is an acronym for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relay". The really nice thing is that posts are resistant to censorship and are cryptographically validated.

Nostr is the _technology_ and one can use any number of Nostr _apps_ to post Twitter-like updates. Authentication is handled with a public/private keypair that can be generated in different ways. I like using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp" target="_blank">nos2x browser extension</a> which allows you to sign Nostr events on web-apps without having to give them your keys.

There are many apps you can use. It seems **Primal** and **Snort** are some of the most popular apps. The interface is similar to Twitter.

 Check out the list of <a href="https://www.nostrapps.com/" target="_blank">Nostr apps</a> and their respective categories. The app <a href="https://nostr.watch/relays/find" target="_blank">nostr.watch</a> has a nice list of available relays.

I will probably start posting my mixes on Nostr more. I am already thinking about closing my Twitter account since at the time of this writing those who aren't logged into Twitter can't even view posts.

For now, you can check out either link below where I will post mixes and updates. All posts will show up across the Nostr ecosystem regardless of app one uses.
