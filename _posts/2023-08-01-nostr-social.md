I was recently introduced to a decentralized social network named <a href="https://nostr.com/" target="_blank">Nostr</a> as a very strong rival to Twitter. Nostr is the technology and one can use any number of Nostr apps. Authentication is handled with a public/private keypair that can be generated in different ways. I like using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp" target="_blank">nos2x browser extension</a> which allows you to sign Nostr events on web-apps without having to give them your keys.

There are many apps you can use. It seems Primal and Iris are some of the most popular apps that look similar to Twitter.

I will probably start posting my mixes on Nostr more. I am already thinking about closing my Twitter account since at the time of this writing those who aren't logged into Twitter can't even view posts.

For now, you can check out either link below where I will post mixes and updates. Single posts will show up across the Nostr ecosystem regardless of app someone uses.
