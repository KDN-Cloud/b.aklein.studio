So after a long hiatus I returned to my music passion in 2022. We are now over half way through 2023 and I thought I would use this space to jot down what I have been doing since getting back to it.

## Back in the days
I grew up learning how to mix tracks on crappy turntables in the mid-90s the old fashioned way. These were second hand belt-drive turntables from a thrift store. I still have my Technics turntables, but they are not the _first_ Technics on which I learned to really mix on. I swore by vinyl for decades. I was a vinyl enthusiast before the digital age boomed. I still love collecting vinyl, but today I prefer being more of a minimalist. I don't have a lot of space for records at the present time, anyway. Regardless, I will say I was stoked this b-day year when I was gifted Weezer's The Blue Album that was released in 1994. I have never mixed out at a club because I never really pursued it, but I have mixed live DJ sets at plenty of house parties, college radio and internet radio. DJing has always been a passion for me. Due to circumstances around 2013 I stopped DJing and messing with music production that I had no proper production gear for.

## What's new?
So fast forward to 2023 I was mixing on turntables and decided I needed to finally learn to mix on a full digital setup with CDJs. I started off with a Pioneer DDJ-1000SRT since the only DVS I used was Serato back when it was called "Serato Scratch Live". The parts shortage is still a big problem today, so waiting on new DJ gear can take months. I got acustomed to CDJ jogwheels pretty fast using the DDJ-1000SRT controller. 

Not too long after that I picked up a couple Pioneer CDJ-3000s and the latest Pioneer DJM-A9 mixer. Boy is that A9 a beast I gotta say and I think the DJ world, too. For portability and fun on the go DJing, I picked up the Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 controller. It looks like a kid's toy, but DJing with its simplistic layout design is enjoyable. Rekordbox in now my favorite DJ software next to Serato. I find Rekordbox superior to Serato in many ways.

Over time I put together a proper home studio. Gear Acquisition Syndrome is definitely real. I have gone down the music production rabbit hole and am very excited to start creating, but I haven't jumped the gun fully, probably because I am too focused on DJing. I have been buying a lot of underground music and programming playlists in Rekordbox for DJ mix recordings. Once the DJ mixes are mastered, I post them on [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/akindamix/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/aksf) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mixingunderground).

Eventually I will be streaming on social networks like [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/akindamix/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/akunderground) and [Kick](https://kick.com/akunderground). It is a work in progress. I will likely be using Restream's service to multistream live video across networks.

## Recording
To record my DJ sets I could just use Rekordbox software, but I took it a step further. I picked up an **iRig Stream Pro** audio interface that connects to the back of my DJM-A9 mixer's **REC OUT**. The other end of the iRig connects to an iPad Mini with a USB-C to Mini-DIN cable. On the iPad I purchased the **SoundLab Audio Editor** app and it works great for recording my DJ sets. The raw recordings are exported as uncompressed audio files for the best audio quality.

## What's next?
Right now I am focused on building an online music presence and following. I currently live out of state, but I have plans on moving back to North California soon where I will be in a better position to focus on live streaming. As things slowly build I will be looking to play out at any gigs that support underground music. I am in a better place in life and am excited for the days ahead.

Thanks for reading~
