A while back I was running a fairly manual internet radio setup — Icecast2 and MPD doing 
the heavy lifting, managed mostly from the command line. It worked, but it wasn't something 
I'd call a platform.

That's changed. I've moved the whole operation over to [AzuraCast](https://www.azuracast.com/), 
and it's been a significant upgrade. AzuraCast is a self-hosted web radio management platform 
that still runs Icecast under the hood, but wraps it in everything you'd actually want — a 
proper web UI, AutoDJ with playlist scheduling, live DJ takeover, listener statistics, multiple 
mount points, and more. It runs in Docker and the setup is clean.

The station is **Lounge24 Radio** — built around a vibe of continuous music with room for 
live DJ sets when the mood strikes. The goal is a place where the music doesn't stop.

You can follow along or contribute at the project repo:

More to come — deeper write-ups on the AzuraCast setup, live streaming workflow, and how 
this all ties into the broader homelab infrastructure.

The decks are warm. 🎧
