Like Serato Stems, Rekordbox has its own [TRACK SEPARATION](https://rekordbox.com/en/support/faq/trackseperation-6/#faq-q600181) function that divides a track into **Vocal**, **Drums**, and **INST** parts so the audio of each can be heard independently or in combinations of 2 or all 3 parts.

## Enabling
To enable the TRACK SEPARATION function, select the box, **Enable the TRACK SEPARATION Function** in **[Preferences] > [Extensions] > [TRACK SEPARATION]**.

## Midi Mappings
I made a couple of midi mappings to support Rekordbox TRACK SEPERATION also known as Stems. Importing a midi mapping is fairly simple. To import, we need to be in Rekordbox **Performance** mode. 

With any supported [hardware unlock](https://rekordbox.com/en/support/hardware-unlock/) gear, the **MIDI** button will be available towards the top-right of Rekordbox. Click the **IMPORT** button and browse to the location where you saved the mapping file and select it. Done.

Notice you will now have three new functions:
- **Active Part Drums**
- **Active Part Inst**
- **Active Part Vocal**

### Download
Rekordbox mappings are just CSV files. Feel free to grab a Rekordbox mapping I made for Pioneer's **DDJ-FLX4** and AKAI'S **LPD8 MK2** pad controller.
