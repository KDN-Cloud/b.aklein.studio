Lately I have been more ambitious than ever with the building blocks of maintaining an online presence. Clearly, as DJs and music producers this is critically important. I have never really been a fan of social networks like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok for personal reasons, but I think I will at least launch a Twitter page simply for promoting purposes. 

So far I am content with presence on Mixcloud, SoundCloud and YouTube. I have been learning to use Adobe Express to help create my own artwork covers and logos. I have also been learning Adobe Audition specifically for creating DJ drop samples, but this is a post for another time.

Check out my YouTube channel's new logo.
