Lately I have been more ambitious than ever with the building blocks of maintaining an online presence. Clearly, as DJs and music producers this is critically important. I have never really been a fan of social networks like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok for personal reasons, but I think I will at least launch a Twitter page simply for promoting purposes. 

So far I am content with presence on, [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/aksf) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@soulfulspinner). My [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soulfulspinner) and [Kick](https://kick.com/soulfulspinner) DJ pages are all ready to go. It looks like I will be using [Restream](https://restream.io/about) to stream live video across multiple networks.

I have been learning to use Adobe Express to help create my own artwork covers and logos. I have also been learning Adobe Audition specifically for creating DJ drop samples, but that is a post for another time.

Check out my YouTube channel's new logo.
