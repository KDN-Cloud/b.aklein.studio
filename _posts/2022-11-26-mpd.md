title: "Internet Radio with Icecast2 and MPD"

I recently set up an Internet Radio server in AWS using [Icecast2](https://github.com/KDN-Cloud/icecast) and MPD ([Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/)). The basic idea was I would have a `stream` mount point for Live studio mix broadcasts that a DJ or Producer could connect to. Then, a second mount for `radio` broadcasts that is basically an "autodj" controlled by MPD. The song playlists are managed with ncurses based MPD client, [ncmpcpp](https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/).

## ncmpcpp cheat sheet
I was looking for a cheat sheet and found [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh). Using an alias one could type `cht` and get the cheat sheet for ncmpcpp printed to standard output.

`alias cht='curl cheat.sh/ncmpcpp'`

```

    {                  Move cursor up one artist
    }                  Move cursor down one artist
    Page Up            Page up
    Page Down          Page down

    End                End

    Tab                Switch to next screen in sequence
    Shift-Tab          Switch to previous screen in sequence
    F1                 Show help
    1                  Show playlist
    2                  Show browser
    3                  Show search engine
    4                  Show media library
    5                  Show playlist editor
    6                  Show tag editor
    7                  Show outputs
    8                  Show music visualizer
    =                  Show clock
    @                  Show server info
...
...
```

So Icecast can happily serve `/radio` broadcasting 24x7 and an available `/stream` for live studio broadcasts.
